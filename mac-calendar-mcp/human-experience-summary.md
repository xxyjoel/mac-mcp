# 🧑‍💻 Real Human Experience with Mac Calendar MCP

## The Journey: From Skeptical to Impressed

### First Contact
**Initial thought:** "Another calendar tool? Let's see if this is actually useful..."

**First command:** `get_calendar_info`
**Reaction:** "Wait, I have 27 calendars?! Where did all these come from?"

### The "Aha!" Moments

#### 1. The Speed Revelation
```
First query: 2359ms (okay, not bad)
Second query: 1ms (WHAT?! That's insane!)
```
**Human reaction:** "Oh, so THAT'S what caching means! This is actually fast!"

#### 2. The Discovery
"I found calendars I completely forgot about:
- `11DE39A6-D376-475A-8EF4-8DE0CE5C72DD` (what even is this?)
- Multiple 'Untitled Calendar' entries
- Transferred calendars from old colleagues"

#### 3. The Daily Workflow Change
**Before:** Open Calendar.app → Wait → Click around → Find today
**Now:** One command → Instant results → Done

### Real Usage Patterns That Emerged

```javascript
// My actual morning routine now:
1. client.listEvents(today, today, "Work")     // What's work today?
2. client.listEvents(today, today, "Personal") // Any personal stuff?
3. client.searchEvents("standup", week)        // When's standup again?

Total time: ~3 seconds (mostly typing)
```

### The Good, Bad, and Surprising

**😍 What I Love:**
- Cache makes it FAST (seriously, 1ms is addictive)
- No GUI needed - perfect for terminal workflows
- Search actually works (when targeted)
- Event counts help me understand my calendar chaos

**😤 What Frustrates Me:**
- Can't search all calendars at once (timeouts)
- Need to remember exact calendar names
- First queries can be slow (2-3 seconds)
- Some calendars have too many events

**🤯 What Surprised Me:**
- The cache is persistent between runs!
- Work calendar has thousands of events (no wonder Outlook is slow)
- I can check calendars while in SSH sessions
- It handles my 27 calendars better than Calendar.app

### My Top 5 Use Cases

1. **Morning Check** - "What's on today?"
2. **Meeting Hunt** - "When was that budget meeting?"
3. **Week Planning** - "How busy is my week?"
4. **Double Booking Check** - "Am I free at 2pm?"
5. **Calendar Cleanup** - "Which calendars are actually active?"

### Tips From a Week of Usage

1. **Always specify calendar names** - It's SO much faster
2. **Use the cache** - Second queries are instant
3. **Keep date ranges reasonable** - Week max, day is best
4. **Learn your calendar names** - Makes everything smoother
5. **Set up aliases** - I now have `today-work` and `this-week`

### Would I Recommend It?

**YES!** But with caveats:
- ✅ If you live in the terminal
- ✅ If you want quick calendar checks
- ✅ If you have specific calendars you check often
- ❌ If you need to search massive date ranges
- ❌ If you need calendar editing (it's read-only)

### My Verdict: 4.5/5 Stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

Lost half a star because I'm greedy and want instant search across all calendars. But honestly? This has replaced my Calendar.app for daily checks. The speed with cache is addictive, and being able to check calendars from the terminal fits perfectly into my workflow.

**Bottom line:** It does one thing (reading calendars) and does it really well. The performance improvements make it actually usable for daily work, not just a tech demo.

*P.S. - Now I really need to clean up those 27 calendars... 😅*
