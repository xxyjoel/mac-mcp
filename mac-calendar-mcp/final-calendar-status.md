# Mac Calendar MCP Server - Status Report

## Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **MCP Server is functional** - It starts and accepts connections
2. **Calendar access granted** - Can read calendar names and count
3. **Claude Code SDK integration** - Successfully connects via MCP protocol
4. **Tools are available** - list_events, get_event, search_events

### ❌ Performance Issues:
1. **Large calendar data** - Your calendars (especially work calendars like `joel.proctor@vasion.com`) contain so many events that queries timeout
2. **AppleScript limitations** - The current implementation struggles with calendars containing thousands of events
3. **Date filtering performance** - Filtering events by date in AppleScript is slow for large datasets

### 📊 Your Calendar System:
- **Total Calendars**: 27 (though some appear to be duplicates or system calendars)
- **Active Calendars**: 
  - joel.proctor@vasion.com (work)
  - joel@bluearch.io (work)
  - joel@bottlecosts.com (work)
  - Personal
  - Work
  - Home
  - Various shared/transferred calendars
  
### 🔧 Why "No Events Today" Shows Up:
The queries are timing out before they can return results. Your calendars likely DO have events today, but the current implementation can't retrieve them efficiently enough.

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### 1. Optimize the Calendar Client:
```typescript
// Instead of loading ALL events then filtering:
// Current approach (slow)
set allEvents to (events of cal whose start date >= startDate and start date <= endDate)

// Better approach would be:
// - Use Calendar.app's built-in views
// - Implement pagination
// - Cache results
```

### 2. Add Timeout Configuration:
- Allow longer timeouts for large calendars
- Implement progressive loading
- Add calendar-specific timeout settings

### 3. Implement Caching:
- Cache calendar event counts
- Store recent queries
- Update incrementally

### 4. For Claude Code Usage:
When using this MCP server with Claude Code:
- Always specify calendar names (don't search all)
- Use smaller date ranges (1-3 days max)
- Target specific calendars known to have fewer events

## Example Working Commands:
```javascript
// These should work better:
await client.callTool('list_events', {
  startDate: '2025-07-07',
  endDate: '2025-07-07',
  calendarName: 'Home'  // Smaller calendar
});

// Avoid:
await client.callTool('list_events', {
  startDate: '2025-07-07',
  endDate: '2025-07-07'
  // No calendar specified = searches all 27 calendars
});
```

## Conclusion:
The MCP server architecture is sound and working correctly. The performance issues stem from the large volume of calendar data combined with AppleScript's limitations when handling large datasets. The server would benefit from a more efficient calendar querying mechanism, possibly using Calendar.app's frameworks directly instead of AppleScript.
